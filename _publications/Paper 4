collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Here, we study the Riemann problem for a strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws, which occurs in gas dynamics and nonlinear elasticity. We establish
the existence and uniqueness of the solution of Riemann problem containing
delta shock wave by employing self-similar vanishing viscosity approach. We
prove that delta shock is stable under self-similar viscosity perturbation, which
ensures that delta shock wave is a unique entropy solution.'
